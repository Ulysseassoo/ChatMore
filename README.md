# ChatMore

This project is a chatapp made in React with Typescript. The ultimate goal of this project was to discover Typescript and use Redux/Zustand. Also use and discover Supabase, as an online database to manage users and authentication.

This whole application took time, it was a thorough experience for me as I did the design before doing everything.

You can find more images in the screenshots section !
